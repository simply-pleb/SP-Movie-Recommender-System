# SP-Movie-Recommender-System
    A recommender system is a type of information filtering system that suggests items or content to users based on their interests, preferences, or past behavior. These systems are commonly used in various domains, such as e-commerce, entertainment, social media, and online content platforms.

In this repository I will use GNN model in order to build a movie recommender system based on MovieLens 100K Dataset.

The model considered so far is LightGCN.

### Usability

The model is written in lightGCN notebook. In order to work with it, consider installing requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The work is not yet finished. Dataloaders should be implemented in order to load the data in batches. After that the model should start training. Didnt have time to finish it by the deadline.
